0 The Fool

On your quest for perfection you are misled by the light. Be careful for you might trip and fall to drown in your unconscious ocean.

We have all been there - a blank sheet searching to be filled.

We've all experienced that moment of uncertainty, staring at a blank canvas, seeking inspiration, searching for purpose, and yearning to find our place in the world.
